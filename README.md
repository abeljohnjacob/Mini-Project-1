# Plot Point – The Real Estate Hub

Our Mini Project, Plot Point - The Real Esatate Hub is a full-stack web application designed for selling real estate properties. Unlike rental platforms, Plot Point focuses on one-time property sales with personalized recommendations powered by Machine Learning.


# Features

- User Authentication (Login/Register)
- Property Search with Filters (Price Range, BHK)
- Property Cards with Images & Descriptions
- Categorized Sections:
  - Recommended For You
  - Recently Viewed
  - Saved Properties
  - New Listings
- Machine Learning-based personalized feed
- Admin Dashboard for managing property listings
- Fully responsive UI (HTML/CSS/JS + Bootstrap)
- Built with Python (Flask/Django) and MySQL


# ML Recommendation Logic

- Tracks user search frequency
- If a user searches for similar properties more than twice, those properties are highlighted in their feed
- Smart re-ranking of properties based on interaction patterns
